# CS361_project_one

Going to add the code I made in my gitlab repo to this one.
I kinda wish I would have remembered I had this one a gitlab I was supposed to
use.

Q:Anyway What is this?
A: A rust based microservice that will take mouse events and give back a 
heatmap of usage.


TODO:

-Get the rust server to work, AKA a page to pop up. DONE!
-Figure out format for x,y data for mouse events that I will accept.
-Write code to accept that data into a local variable for processing
-Write stuff to use the click events to draw up a page or image.
-Have the server send that image or page back(Whatever takes less bandwidth)
